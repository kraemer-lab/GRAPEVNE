# Epi-curves and distributions

EpiLine is a package for estimating epi-curves and distributions from case line list data. This package contains models for estimating epi-curves and individual infection progression distributions simultaneously.

The following modules wrap the EpiLine package for use in GRAPEVNE workflows:
Module repository: [kraemer-lab/vneyard](https://github.com/kraemer-lab/vneyard)
Project: EPI

Of note are the core module (`EpiLine`) and simulation module (`EpiLine_Simulation`). When combined with other utility modules (such as plotting, or loading data from files), these provide a powerful tool for estimating epi-curves and distributions from case line list data.
