# Converting a python script to a GRAPEVNE module

We are going to convert a script designed for geospatial analysis into a GRAPEVNE module.
The specifics of the script are not important, although if you would like to run the
analysis yourself you will need the following additional files:
- `vnm_general_2020.csv` ([zip file](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/191b04c5-3dc7-4c2a-8e00-9c0bdfdfbf9d/resource/fade8620-0935-4d26-b0c6-15515dd4bf8b/download/vnm_general_2020_geotiff.zip) available
from the [Humanitariuan Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/)).
- `vnm_relative_wealth_index.csv` ([csv file](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/76f2a2ea-ba50-40f5-b79c-db95d668b843/resource/06d29bc0-5a4c-4be0-be1a-c546a9be540c/download/vnm_relative_wealth_index.csv) available from [Humanitariuan Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/)).
- [Vietnam shape files](https://geodata.ucdavis.edu/gadm/gadm4.1/shp/gadm41_VNM_shp.zip) available from [GADM](https://gadm.org)

We are going to convert the following script, called `rwi_proc_and_agg.py` that performs
preprocessing and aggregation of relative wealth index data onto a geographic shape file.
The script will produce as output a map file in `.png` format:

```python
# Author: Prathyush Sambaturu

# of Vietnam. The code for aggregated is adapted from the following tutorial:

```

As we can see, this script is self-contained, but has been written for a very specific
use-case, and references filenames directly. Our aim is to generalise the script so that
it can be adopted into other research projects with minimal complexity.

Our first decision relates to the function of this script. The script performs two
functions at present, it processes the incoming data (shape file and relative wealth
index), producing a shape file as output, but it also *plots* the shape file. There are
also references to specific column names that may need to be altered in a
datafile-specific way. For maximum flexibility we might consider separating out these
functions, but for now we will process and display the data as described in the script.

## Parameterisation

Before we consider how to wrap the script into a GRAPEVNE module, we first need to
make the script flexible to different inputs and parameters. We do this by parameterising
the script.

To parameterise the script we need to identify which aspects may change in future usage.
This is not always a straightforward decision, but here we will isolate the following:
- Shape file location (`shpfile`)
- Relative wealth index file location (`rwifile`)
- Population file location (`popfile`)
- `gid_id` will be a new parameter replacing the hardcoded use of `"GID_2"`
- Finally, we provide a custom output filename location (`outfile`) for the resulting .png image

Let's focus on the shape file for now, because the logic of parameterising the other
options is similar. We want to be able to run this script with any shape file
(corresponding to potentially any country). To do this at the moment requires us to
alter the script itself. We need to generalise the script in order to take the name
of the shape file as an *input*. For some parameters, such as `gid_id` we can provide
them with default values, while for others we may wish to make their specification
compulsory.

A well-established and straightforward mechanism to achieve parameterisation is by passing
command-line arguments to the script. For example, instead of launching the script
using:
```bash
python rwi_proc_and_agg.py
```
we might instead launch the script using:
```bash
python rwi_proc_and_agg.py --shpfile="data/gadm41_VNM_shp/gadm41_VNM_2.shp"
```

While this may look more complicated to launch, it affords us a mechanism to control the
script *without changing the code directly*, and thus provides flexibilty. Note also that by the
time we have modularised this script into GRAPEVNE, these parameters will form part of
the module configuration, so there will be no need for us to memorise the parameter
names, or any need to type out the above command to launch it!

### Implementing command line arguments in the script

To enable the script to recognise these command line arguments we will need to perform
some basic refactoring (note that this is not essential, but recommended). To begin, we
will clean the script by placing all of the main code into a single function. We
parameterise this function with the parameters of interest (in this case `shpfile`,
`rwifile` and `popfile`), and remove their definitions (lines 70-72 of the original
script). We also replace the two instances of `"GID_2"` with `gid_id`.

Briefly:
```python
# Keep all the import statements here

# Define a function to hold the main code
# Here we call it 'main', but any name will suffice
def main(shpfile, rwifile, popfile, gid_id, outfile):
    ...
    # Script code goes here #
    ...

# This code block is run when the script is launched
# We will place our command-line arguments parser here
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()  # <-- We still need to supply the input arguments here
```

We now need to add our command-line argument parser. There are several ways to do this,
but the simplest is to use the [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)
module that comes with python. There are many options that you can use here, but we
only need to accept strings for file locations and for `gid_id`. First, add
`import argparse` to the top of your script, then expand the `main` call
as follows:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Command-line argument parser
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--shpfile', type=str, default='')
    parser.add_argument('--rwifile', type=str, default='')
    parser.add_argument('--popfile', type=str, default='')
    parser.add_argument('--gid_id', type=str, default='GID_2')
    parser.add_argument('--outfile', type=str, default='')
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Call main function with given parameters
    main(args.shpfile, args.rwifile, args.popfile, args.gid_id, args.outfile)
```

The full file now looks like this:
```python

    main(args.shpfile, args.rwifile, args.popfile, args.gid_id, args.outfile)

We can now launch this script from the command-line with the following call:
```bash
python rwi_proc_and_agg.py \
    --shpfile="data/gadm41_VNM_shp/gadm41_VNM_2.shp" \
    --rwifile="data/vnm_relative_wealth_index.csv" \
    --popfile="data/vnm_general_2020.csv" \
    --gid_id="GID_2" \
    --outfile="rwi_weight_admin3.png"
```

We can add additional parameters to the script in this way and provide them with default
values that can be overriden by the user. Importantly, we no longer need to alter our
script in order to change these settings, making this script much more suitable for
re-use. Next, we will package the script into a GRAPEVNE module.

## Modularise

GRAPEVNE modules are essentially `snakemake` workflows that conform to our extended
specification. To wrap the above script into a module, we create the following folder
structure, placing our script into the `resources/scripts` folder:
```
RWI_ProcAndAgg
└── config
    └── config.yaml
└── resources
    └── scripts
        └── rwi_proc_and_agg.py
└── workflow
    └── Snakefile
    └── envs
        └── conda.yaml

└── results
    └── shape_in
        └── gadm41_VNM_2.shp
    └── rwi_in
        └── vnm_relative_wealth_index.csv
    └── pop_in
        └── vnm_general_2020.csv
```

The results folder is displayed separately because it does not form part of the module
directly, but will be used to test the module - hence the presence of our three
input files (you may wonder why we have separated these into three distinct folder -
that is to replicate the three input namespaces, as detailed below).
The folder structure we use for modules follows [Snakemake's Distribution and Reproducibility](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/deployment.html) guidelines.
There are three new files we need to consider:
- `Snakefile` contains our module rule(s)
- `config.yaml` contains the configuration for our module
- `conda.yaml` provides the dependency specification for our module

### config.yaml

We start with the `config.yaml` file, as we will use these settings in the workflow
file later on. Here, we must provide details of the input and output namespaces.
Consider that we require three files (`shpfile`, `rwifile`, `popfile`) for our script
to run. Remember than the use (in GRAPEVNE) will be able to change these settings. So,
we could list the three filenames as parameters so that the user can change them in
their own workflows. This is actually problematic since the user may not want to link
directly to filenames on their computer, and may even want to connect to a database or
download the files from a server somewhere. A better solution would be to allow the user
to provide these files to our module from another module (the other module could be
a `Download` module, or `Local file` module, or `Database` module - the point is that
the user can (re)configure this themselves in GRAPEVNE). To specify this, we use the
following `config.yaml` file:
```yaml
input_namespace:
  shape: "shape_in"
  rwi: "rwi_in"
  pop: "pop_in"
output_namespace: "out"
params:
  "Root shape file": "gadm41_VNM_2.shp"
  "RWI file": "vnm_relative_wealth_index.csv"
  "Population file": "vnm_general_2020.csv"
  "GID ID": "GID_2"
  "Output image": "rwi_weight_admin3.png"
```

To explain the configuration: We have defined three namespaces that are accessible to
our module, named `shape`, `rwi` and `pop`, and mapped them to the input
namespaces (aka folders) `shape_in`, `rwi_in` and `pop_in`, respectively (we really
don't need the `_in` postfix here, but it helps us to clarify the difference between the
'named' input and their folders in this case). Note that namespace values
(e.g. `shape_in`) will be overwritten by GRAPEVNE during any workflow build process. We
only specify defaults here to help us test the module using our local files.

Finally, we provide the filenames that the script will look for when processing the data.
We provide these as parameters so that they can be altered by the user on a
case-by-case basis. By wrapping our parameter names in quotes we can use human readable
expressions. Since the parameter names are exposed to the user, this is a good
opportunity to make the user-facing information more friendly.


### Snakefile

Next, we define the 'rules' of our module (most of this is boilerplate
supporting the script call in the `shell` directive). We specify the following workflow
file:
```python
"""Relative Wealth Index Preprocessing and aggregation

This module provides relative welath index preprocessing and aggregation functions,
producing a graphical plot which is also output as a png file.

Tags: relative-wealth-index, plot

Params:
    Root shape file (string): Filename for the root shape [.shp] file ('shape' namespace)
    RWI file (string): Filename for the relative welath index [.csv] file ('rwi' namespace)
    Population file (string): Filename for the population [.csv] file ('pop' namespace)
    GID ID (string): GID region (e.g. "GID_2")
    Output image (string): Filename for the output map [.png] file
"""
configfile: "config/config.yaml"
from snakemake.remote import AUTO
params = config["params"]

rule target:
    input:
        shpfile=expand(
            "results/{indir}/{filename}",
            indir=config["input_namespace"]["shape"],
            filename=params["Root shape file"],
        ),
        rwifile=expand(
            "results/{indir}/{filename}",
            indir=config["input_namespace"]["rwi"],
            filename=params["RWI File"],
        ),
        popfile=expand(
            "results/{indir}/{filename}",
            indir=config["input_namespace"]["pop"],
            filename=params["Population File"],
        ),
        script=AUTO.remote(
            srcdir("../resources/scripts/rwi_proc_and_agg.py")
        ),
    output:
        expand(
            "results/{outdir}/{filename}",
            outdir=config["output_namespace"],
            filename=params["Output image"]
        ),
    params:
        gid_id=params["GID ID"],
    conda:
        "envs/conda.yaml"
    shell:
        """
        python {input.script} \
            --shpfile="{input.shpfile}" \
            --rwifile="{input.rwifile}" \
            --popfile="{input.popfile}" \
            --gid_id="{params.gid_id}" \
            --outfile="{output}"
        """
```

Note the `Snakefile` begins with a docstring that provides information to the user about
this module, as-well as parameter descriptions, and some tag information to help the user
find the module in searches.

Next we specify the configuration filename, import a package that we will use later
(using standard python syntax) and define a convenient shortcut to the
parameters in our config (`params = config["params"]`).

After the preamble we define our rules. There is only one in this case so we could call
it anything we like, but by default (in the case where there are multiple rules),
GRAPEVNE will look for a `target` rule first.

The `target` rule contains a number of directives specifying the inputs to the rule
(shape file, rwi file and population files in this case). These are `expand`ed from the
`input_namespace` and parameters to provide their complete filenames at runtime.
We also list the script itself as a necessary input. The
`AUTO.remote` wrapper ensures that the file is downloaded from its remote location when
the rule is run (unfortunately this does not work if running the rule locally, see
below).

```{note}
While `AUTO.remote` downloads files from their remote provider, it does not allow you
to specify local filenames. Until a fix is provided, it is best to leave the `AUTO.remote`
function call out while testing your module locally.
```

The output of the module is the `.png` file generated by the script. This filename is
likewise constructed from the output namespace and parameter list. The output file
needs to be placed into the `output_namespace` folder (hence the use of `expand` here).
There is also no restriction that only a single file is output - we could instead
output multiple files (or folders) to this namespace.

The `conda` directive provides our dependency list for the module - more on this below.

Finally, the `script` directive runs our script. Notice that this is a replica of our
earlier command, just with the input parameters replaced with generalied inputs.

There are other directives that we could include if we are interested in logging,
benchmarks, or running rules in containers, but these would only detract from the
core principles for this demonstration.

### conda.yaml

The `conda.yaml` file provides a list of dependencies that will be set-up as a `conda`
environment when the module in run through `snakemake`. We only need `python` and some
python-package dependencies that we will install using `pip` . We obtain `python` and
`pip` from the `bioconda` channel. Then, we use `pip` to install the package
dependencies (the specific packages are those listed in the `import` statements of our
script).
```yaml
channels:
  - bioconda
dependencies:
  - python
  - pip:
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - descartes
    - geopandas
    - shapely
    - contextily
    - numpy
    - pyquadkey2
```

## Integration with GRAPEVNE

If you have any problems, the above module is available from the `kraemer-lab/vneyard`
under the `Tutorials` project, named `RWI_ProcAndAgg`.

### Testing with snakemake

It's always useful to be able to run your workflow directly from the command-line to
look for errors. There are actually a few useful tools that will help you here:
- `snakemake --lint` performs linting of your workflow
- `snakemake --d3dag` will determine and report the directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure of your workflow; this is useful when linking multiple rules, but also verifies that the workflow is valid, builds in the way that you are expecting, and that all input files are present (when testing).
- `snakemake --cores 1 --use-conda` will launch the workflow. The `use-conda` argument informs snakemake to make use of the `conda` configuration to set-up the module environment prior to execution.

```{note}
A common problem that crops up at this point relates to newer Apple Mac computers, and
specifically those with M-series processors. Some software packages (including some
python packages) do not provide native builds for these processors. If you have
difficulty running the workflow and are receiving an error similar to:
`This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip` then
you can try forcing conda to use the Intel versions of software by specifying
`CODA_SUBDIR=osx-64 snakemake --cores 1 --use-conda`.
```

You will find the resulting file in the `output_namespace` folder, namely
`results/out/rwi_weight_admin3.png` (using the default values).

### Loading into GRAPEVNE

Once everything works in `snakemake` we can copy the `RWI_ProcAndAgg` folder into a
GRAPEVNE repository and load it for inclusion in broader workflows. Open GRAPEVNE now,
add your repository to the GRAPEVNE repository list (under Settings), load the modules,
then drag `RWI_ProcAndAgg` into the GRAPEVNE workspace. Now we have our script, usable
as a GRAPEVNE module. However, to replicate our starting analysis we will also need to
provide the input files (shape, population and rwi files) for the analysis. The rwi and
population files are single file, and although the shape file is specified as a `.shp`,
the script will actually attempt to load several other associated file. For the single
files, located on our local hard disk then we can make use of the
`Local file` module available in the `kraemer-lab/vneyard` repository. However, for the
set of shape files we will use the `Local folder` module.

Locate the `Local file` module in the
module list and drag it into the GRAPEVNE workspace. Open its properties and
change its name (to help you keep track) and its filename settings so that it
points to the location of the local folder containing either the rwi or population
`.csv` file. Repeat the process for the second file. For the shape files you will need
to drag the `Local folder` module, rename it and provide the appropriate path to the
shape files. Now, connect the `Local folder`s to the appropriate inputs of the
`RWI_ProcAndAgg` module and the `Local folder` module to the `shape` input.

Your final workflow should look something like this:
```{figure} RWI_ProcAndAgg.png

```

We are now ready to `Build and Test` run your workflow. After waiting a minute or two
for the `conda` environments to download, you will see a Log message stating that your
conda environment has been activated. The script itself takes several minutes to run,
but when it is finished you should see `Workflow complete` and you will have access to
your analysed shapefile in the `results` folder. You can switch to the build-in
`Terminal` to open the image. On MacOS the command will be similar to:
`open results/tutorials_rwi_procandagg/rwi_weight_admin3.png`.
Congratulations, you are now equipped to convert your standalone scripts into
reusable GRAPEVNE modules!
